# Server

This is the thermit server.

## Development

The server can be build with `cargo build`.

To run the server in watch mode, first install `cargo-watch` using `cargo install cargo-watch`. Then run `cargo watch -x run`.
Now with every change made in the code, the server will automatically recompile and continue running.
